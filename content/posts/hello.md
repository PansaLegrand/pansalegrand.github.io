Welcome to my teaching project! 🎓  

This site will be my personal backup and publication space for all the materials I’m preparing on **deep learning fundamentals**. The first big series I’m working on is about **backpropagation** — how it works, why it matters, and how modern frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow implement it.  

## What You’ll Find Here
- **Step-by-step lessons** on calculus, derivatives, and the chain rule.  
- Detailed walkthroughs of **manual backpropagation** in small neural networks.  
- Explanations of **autodiff systems** in modern frameworks.  
- Advanced topics like **control flow in models** (e.g., Mixture-of-Experts) and how gradients behave.  

## Why I’m Doing This
I want to create a resource that blends **math intuition + coding practice**, so that learners can go from *“I know what the chain rule is”* → *“I can debug my gradients in PyTorch.”*  

## Next Steps
Stay tuned — I’ll start releasing the course chapters here, one by one. Each chapter will include:
- A **detailed article** (like a mini-lecture).  
- Supporting **math notes**.  
- Example **Python/PyTorch code**.
